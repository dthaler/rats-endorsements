      "body": "- The following is NOT always applicable: \r\n> where actual state has a single value per claim per component applying to one device at one point in time, reference state has a set of values per claim per component (\u00a72)\r\n\r\nIt may very well be the case that there is only one Reference Value per Claim per component (e.g., _MRENCLAVE_ in SGX).\r\n\r\n- The following is NOT always the case: \r\n> Actual state: Evidence, Endorsements, Attestation Results (\u00a72.1)\r\n\r\nAs a counterexample, _CPUSVN_ inside PCK cert (Endorsement) may be older than the one in Evidence (QE Report Body). \r\n\r\n- I think the draft currently focuses on a very specific case rather than the goal stated in the abstract: \r\n> explains the purpose and role of Endorsements\r\n\r\nOne of the major purposes of Endorsements is to provide identity endorsement, which is never discussed in the draft. \r\n\r\n- Clarify \"group of claims\" vs. \"set of claims\" (e.g., as used in \u00a72)\r\n\r\n- Clarify the definition of \"Claim\" and explain: \r\n> for our purposes we will treat such a list as a single unit (\u00a72)\r\n\r\nFor example, I am thinking about _attributes_ and _Security Version Numbers_ in SGX/TDX. For instance, SGX TCB Security Version Number (SVN) has 16 components, so would each component be treated as a Claim, or would the SVN be treated as a single unit?\r\n\r\n- Clarify \"reference values\" vs. \"Reference Values\" ",

You could have a feed that only supports endorsed keys, from certain parties and for certain purposes, but with support for multiple key content types.",
